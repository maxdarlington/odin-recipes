            <h2>The Best Peri Peri Chicken Recipe You Can Find!</h2>
            <p>This peri peri chicken recipe features a great spicy marinade for an African dish that's great for a barbecue. Nice with salad and fries, but I like adding it to a pita with salad and garlic Greek yogurt (3/4 cup Greek yogurt and 3 cloves of crushed garlic with finely chopped chives). Don't go on a date, though; it gives you wicked garlic breath!</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup fresh lemon juice</li>
                <li>1/4 cup paprika</li>
                <li>2 tbsp hot chili powder</li>
                <li>3 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 1/2 tsp chopped fresh ginger</li>
                <li>1 1/2 tsp of salt</li>
                <li>4 bone in chicken breast halves</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Stir together lemon juice, paprika, chili powder, garlic, ginger, and salt in a large bowl until well combined. Add chicken; rub until well coated and marinate in the refrigerator for 3 hours.</li>
                <li>Preheat a grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grates.</li>
                <li>Place chicken onto the preheated grill; discard marinade. Cook, turning occasionally, until skins are slightly charred and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of chicken should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). </li>
            </ol>
